He looks at his battery meter (Low).\n- **Choice:** He unplugs. He runs into the storm, his joints screaming against the acid.\n- **Climax:** Sprout reaches the garden. He has nothing to cover the plants. He rips a car door off a nearby stack, but it\'s not big enough. He makes the ultimate decision: He kneels over the garden, using his own massive, rusty body as a shield. The acid rain sizzles against his casing. He powers down to conserve energy, freezing in a protective crouch.\n\n**Scene 4: Rebirth**\n- **Setting:** Morning. The storm has passed.\n- **Action:** The sun comes out. Sprout is a rusted statue, immobile. His battery is dead.\n- **Resolution:** Underneath his chest plate, the Dandelion is safe. A breeze blows. The white seeds disperse, floating past Sprout\'s silent face. They land in the mud, in the cracks of tires, inside hollow pipes.\n- **Final Image:** A time-lapse.
