# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to use

When you want to create a new version:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset file
2. Commit the changeset file
3. When ready to release, the CI will create a Release PR
4. Merge the Release PR to publish
